# Elementary-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
CS 2 Homework Assignments and Lab Projects

README

This is a repo on my elementary data structures and algorithms course (CS2). The course coveed the following programming topics:

Arrays: basic operations, sorting and searching algorithms
Basic Object Oriented Programming: classes, objects, inheritance and polymorphism
Linked Lists: singly and doubly linked lists, insertion and deletion operations
Recursion: concept, working with recursive functions
File Reading and Writing: reading from and writing to files
Binary Trees: binary search trees, traversal algorithms
Searching and Sorting Algorithms: linear search, binary search, bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, quicksort, merge sort
Stacks and Queues: working with stacks and queues, applications
Basic Big O Calculation of Running Times: time complexity analysis, understanding big O notation
Each topic is covered in detail, with code examples and exercises to help demonstrate and apply knowledge and skills gained from taking the course. 
The course was designed for building and nurturing a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms.
